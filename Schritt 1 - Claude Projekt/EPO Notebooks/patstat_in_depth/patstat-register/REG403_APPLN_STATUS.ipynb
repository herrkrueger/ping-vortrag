    "Welcome to a detailed exploration of the ``REG403_APPLN_STATUS`` table. This table is fundamental for interpreting the procedural status of patent applications, providing a clear understanding of their progression within the EPO system.\n",

    "The ``REG403_APPLN_STATUS`` table includes two key attributes: ``STATUS``, a code representing the applicationâ€™s current status, and ``STATUS_TEXT``, which offers a descriptive label corresponding to each status code. These attributes serve as a bridge between technical codes and user-friendly explanations, making it easier to analyze and report on application statuses."
