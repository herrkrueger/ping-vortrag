    "The ``SPC_NR`` attribute represents the application and/or publication number assigned to a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). The Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC), which is a special type of patent that provides extra protection for certain pharmaceutical products.  This number is essential for uniquely identifying an SPC within the legal framework of patent protection, allowing for easy reference and retrieval of information regarding specific SPCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain for this attribute allows for up to 40 ASCII characters, accommodating various formats of numbers that may include alphanumeric characters, depending on the issuing authority. As there is no default value assigned, the presence of an ``SPC_NR`` indicates that a valid SPC has been filed or published.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attribute is sourced from the INPADOC database, which documents worldwide legal events pertaining to patents, including SPCs. The ``SPC_NR`` is vital for stakeholders in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as it aids in tracking the status and legal standing of SPCs, which can significantly impact the commercial exploitation of patented products and the management of intellectual property rights.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ``SPC_FILING_DATE`` attribute indicates the filing date of a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC), which is an important legal document that extends the protection of certain pharmaceutical and plant protection products beyond the standard patent term. This date is crucial as it marks the official submission of the SPC application to the relevant authority, initiating the process for obtaining additional market exclusivity for a product.\n",

    "### FEE_COUNTRY\n",
    "\n",
    "The attribute ``FEE_COUNTRY`` specifies the country or territory where the annual renewal fee for a patent has been paid. This field is particularly useful for tracking the distribution of fee payments across various national offices, as it shows which country is responsible for processing the renewal of a patent in its jurisdiction. The value follows WIPO Standard ST.3, using two-character ASCII codes, like \"DE\" for Germany or \"FR\" for France.\n",
    "\n",
    "``FEE_COUNTRY`` is only populated when the event code is \"PGFP\" (Post Grant Fee Paid for an EP patent) or \"VSFP\" (Annual Fee Paid to Validation State). For European patents, renewal fees are not paid directly to the EPO but to the national office of each EPO member state where the patent is valid. This attribute helps provide insights into the territorial scope of EP patents and the fees required to maintain their validity in specific countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FEE_PAYMENT_DATE\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``FEE_PAYMENT_DATE`` attribute records the date on which the annual renewal fee was paid for a European (EP) patent. This date is essential for tracking the timeliness of renewal payments, which help to maintain the validity of a patent within designated countries. Represented in date format, it captures when the payment was completed and is used to verify compliance with national or regional renewal requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default value for this attribute is \"9999-12-31,\" which indicates an unspecified or placeholder date when no actual payment date is recorded. This attribute is sourced from the INPADOC database and reflects fee-payment events documented by national patent offices, providing important temporal insights into patent maintenance activities across various jurisdictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FEE_RENEWAL_YEAR\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``FEE_RENEWAL_YEAR`` attribute indicates the specific year of the renewal cycle for which the annual renewal fee was paid for a European (EP) patent. Represented as a number from 1 to 25, it reflects the year of maintenance, with common entries up to 20, while additional years are occasionally present for cases like supplementary protection certificates (SPCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the ``FEE_PAYMENT_DATE``, which marks the actual payment date, ``FEE_RENEWAL_YEAR`` only records the applicable year in the patent's lifecycle for which the fee was paid. For example, if a renewal fee was paid on April 1, 2020, for the seventh year of renewal, the value of ``FEE_RENEWAL_YEAR`` would be \"7\" rather than \"2020.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, some national patent offices do not require payments for certain years of maintenance. For instance, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Great Britain, Austria, San Marino, and Italy have exemptions from renewal payments for specific early years, which may still generate renewal events (PGFP) if needed for procedural reasons, like translation filing. The INPADOC database provides this information, capturing only the most recent payment record per patent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions as of 2018 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Netherlands have no fee for OY3. \n",
    "* Switzerland has no fee for OY3.\n",
    "* Great Britain has no fee for OY3 and 4.\n",
    "* Austria has no fee for OY 3, 4 and 5.\n",
    "* San Marino has no fee in year 3, but since they require a translation to be filed, there are  PGFP’s for OY3 if needed in the year of due payment\n",
    "* Italy has no fee in years 3 or 4, but since they require a translation to be filed, there are  PGFP’s for OY3 & 4 if needed in the year of due payment\n",
    "\n",
    "### FEE_TEXT\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``FEE_TEXT`` attribute provides additional, free-form information regarding an annual renewal fee payment for a European (EP) patent. This text can include specific remarks"

    "The ``CLASS_SCHEME`` attribute indicates the scheme of the classification used in a patent event, specifically detailing whether the patent is classified under the International Patent Classification (IPC) system. It has a limited domain, with \"IPC\" as the primary value and an empty string as the default when classification data is not available or applicable. This attribute helps clarify which classification system is applied to the patent document in question, supporting standardized referencing and analysis across patents.\n",

This symbol is used to classify patents according to the International Patent Classification (IPC) system. It can be up to 50 ASCII characters long and may vary in structure; some symbols follow the structured WIPO ST.8 format, while others may be unstructured. The default value for this attribute is empty, indicating that the classification symbol may not be provided in some cases. This attribute plays a crucial role in identifying the technical area of the invention within the patent system."
