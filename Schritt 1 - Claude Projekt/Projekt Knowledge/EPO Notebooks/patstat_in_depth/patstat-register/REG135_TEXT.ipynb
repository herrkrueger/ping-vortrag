    "Welcome to an in-depth exploration of the ``REG135_TEXT`` table. This table contains miscellaneous text notes related to patent applications, which can be in one of the three official languages of the European Patent Office (EPO): English, French, or German. These texts provide additional information or clarifications about the application, often in response to issues or observations made during the examination process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``REG135_TEXT`` table offers detailed information, including the language of the text and the actual content of the miscellaneous comments. Each entry is linked to a specific patent application via the ID field, which corresponds to the application ID in the ``REG101_APPLN`` table. This ensures that the comments are directly associated with the relevant patent application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table is crucial for capturing additional remarks that may not be included in the formal documents, helping patent examiners, legal teams, and applicants better understand the context of specific applications."
